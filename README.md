# Psyliq_Data_Analysis_Internship
Hi there! I'm Supriya Bhat V, a proactive data analyst who recently completed a one month internship at Psyliq, successfully tackling three impactful tasks
that involved HR data analysis using Power BI and Excel, Employee Data Analysis using Excel and diabetics prediction using SQL.

### HR DATA ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI AND EXCEL:
- Utilized tools like Excel and Power BI to create visualizations that showcase the distribution of employees across departments, roles, and age groups.
- Analyzed key metrics such as average monthly income, job satisfaction, and salary hike impacts.
- Employ filters and pivot tables to segment data, providing a clear overview of the workforce composition.
- Created visual representations, such as line charts in Power BI, to track trends in employee attrition over the years.
- Utilize calculated columns and DAX to determine average years an employee has spent with their current manager. 
### EMPLOYEE DATA ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL:
- Created a chart to visually represent the distribution of "Work-Life Balance Score" across various job functions.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight employees with a "Performance Score" below 3 in red.
- Utilized a pivot table to consolidate the total number of employees in each department.
- Developed a dashboard integrating charts and pivot tables to provide an overview of key HR metrics, including headcount, performance, and training costs.
### DIABETICS PREDICTION USING SQL:
- Data Retrieval and Filtering: Utilized SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve specific patient information and filter data based on criteria such as age and gender.
- Aggregation and Analysis: Employed aggregate functions (AVG, MAX, MIN) and sorting (ORDER BY) for statistical analysis and insights into patient health metrics.
- Statistical Analysis and Grouping: Demonstrated advanced analysis techniques, including grouping (GROUP BY), counting (COUNT), and ranking (ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK) for 
  nuanced patient categorization.
- Data Modification and Constraints: Showcased data modification using UPDATE, INSERT INTO, and DELETE FROM. Established a UNIQUE constraint on patient IDs for data 
  integrity.
