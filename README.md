# Psyliq_Data_Analysis_Internship
Hi there! I'm Supriya Bhat V, a proactive data analyst who recently completed a one month internship at Psyliq, successfully tackling three impactful tasks
that involved HR data analysis using Power BI and Excel, Employee Data Analysis using Excel and diabetics prediction using SQL.

### HR DATA ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI AND EXCEL:
- Utilized tools like Excel and Power BI to create visualizations that showcase the distribution of employees across departments, roles, and age groups.
- Analyzed key metrics such as average monthly income, job satisfaction, and salary hike impacts.
- Employ filters and pivot tables to segment data, providing a clear overview of the workforce composition.
- Created visual representations, such as line charts in Power BI, to track trends in employee attrition over the years.
- Utilize calculated columns and DAX to determine average years an employee has spent with their current manager. 
## Project Title: Employee Data Analysis using Excel

### Introduction:
I led a comprehensive project aimed at analyzing employee data to derive actionable insights for organizational improvement. Leveraging Excel's advanced functionalities, including pivot tables, conditional formatting, and dashboard creation, I conducted an in-depth examination of various facets of employee performance and demographics.
### Project Objectives:
- Utilize pivot tables to aggregate and summarize large volumes of employee data across multiple dimensions, such as department, tenure, and performance metrics.
- Apply conditional formatting techniques to highlight key trends, outliers, and anomalies within the dataset for further investigation.
- Design interactive dashboards to present the findings of the analysis in a visually appealing and user-friendly format for stakeholders.
### Methodologies:
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed the raw employee dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.
- Pivot Table Analysis: Created pivot tables to dynamically summarize and cross-tabulate employee data, enabling rapid exploration and comparison of various metrics.
- Conditional Formatting: Implemented conditional formatting rules to visually identify trends, outliers, and patterns within the dataset, enhancing data visualization and 
  interpretation.
- Dashboard Creation: Designed interactive dashboards using Excel's features to integrate pivot tables, charts, and slicers, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive view 
  of employee performance and demographics
### Outcomes and Insights:
- Insights from Pivot Tables: Identified department-wise trends in employee performance metrics, such as productivity and attendance, enabling targeted interventions for 
  improvement.
- Impact of Conditional Formatting: Detected anomalies in employee attendance records through color-coded conditional formatting, prompting further investigation into 
  potential issues affecting workforce management.
- Dashboard Visualization: Developed intuitive dashboards that allowed stakeholders to interactively explore employee data, facilitating informed decision-making and 
  strategic planning.
### DIABETICS PREDICTION USING SQL:
- Data Retrieval and Filtering: Utilized SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve specific patient information and filter data based on criteria such as age and gender.
- Aggregation and Analysis: Employed aggregate functions (AVG, MAX, MIN) and sorting (ORDER BY) for statistical analysis and insights into patient health metrics.
- Statistical Analysis and Grouping: Demonstrated advanced analysis techniques, including grouping (GROUP BY), counting (COUNT), and ranking (ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK) for 
  nuanced patient categorization.
- Data Modification and Constraints: Showcased data modification using UPDATE, INSERT INTO, and DELETE FROM. Established a UNIQUE constraint on patient IDs for data 
  integrity.
