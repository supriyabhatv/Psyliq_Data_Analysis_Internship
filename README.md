# Psyliq_Data_Analysis_Internship
Hi there! I'm Supriya Bhat V, a proactive data analyst who recently completed a one month internship at Psyliq, successfully tackling three impactful projects
that involved HR data analysis using Power BI and Excel, Employee Data Analysis using Excel and diabetics prediction using SQL.

## Project Title: HR Data Analysis using Power BI and Excel

### Introduction:
During my internship at Psyliq, I spearheaded an extensive project focused on analyzing HR data to gain insights into various aspects of workforce management and organizational performance. Leveraging the combined power of Power BI and Excel, I conducted a comprehensive examination of HR metrics to inform strategic decision-making and optimize HR processes.

### Project Objectives:
- Utilize Power BI for dynamic data visualization and interactive dashboard creation to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of HR metrics.
- Leverage Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and supplementary visualizations to complement the insights derived from Power BI.
- Analyze key HR metrics such as employee turnover, recruitment effectiveness, performance ratings, and training effectiveness to identify trends, patterns, and areas for 
  improvement.

### Methodologies:
- Data Preparation: Cleaned, transformed, and integrated HR datasets from various sources to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Power BI Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards and reports in Power BI to visualize HR metrics, enabling stakeholders to explore data dynamically and gain 
  actionable insights.
- Excel Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis and supplementary visualizations in Excel to complement the insights derived from Power BI, utilizing advanced Excel functions 
  and pivot tables.
- Integration: Integrated Power BI visualizations and Excel analysis to provide a holistic view of HR data, combining the strengths of both tools for comprehensive analysis 
  and reporting.
  
### Outcomes and Insights:
- Dynamic Visualization with Power BI: Created dynamic dashboards in Power BI that allowed stakeholders to interactively explore HR metrics such as turnover rates, 
  recruitment funnel analysis, and performance ratings over time.
- Granular Analysis in Excel: Conducted granular analysis in Excel to dive deeper into specific HR metrics, such as identifying factors contributing to employee turnover and 
  evaluating the effectiveness of training programs.
- Integration for Comprehensive Insights: Integrated Power BI visualizations with Excel analysis to provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights into HR metrics, 
  facilitating data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

  
## Project Title: Employee Data Analysis using Excel

### Introduction:
I led a comprehensive project aimed at analyzing employee data to derive actionable insights for organizational improvement. Leveraging Excel's advanced functionalities, including pivot tables, conditional formatting, and dashboard creation, I conducted an in-depth examination of various facets of employee performance and demographics.

### Project Objectives:
- Utilize pivot tables to aggregate and summarize large volumes of employee data across multiple dimensions, such as department, tenure, and performance metrics.
- Apply conditional formatting techniques to highlight key trends, outliers, and anomalies within the dataset for further investigation.
- Design interactive dashboards to present the findings of the analysis in a visually appealing and user-friendly format for stakeholders.

### Methodologies:
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed the raw employee dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.
- Pivot Table Analysis: Created pivot tables to dynamically summarize and cross-tabulate employee data, enabling rapid exploration and comparison of various metrics.
- Conditional Formatting: Implemented conditional formatting rules to visually identify trends, outliers, and patterns within the dataset, enhancing data visualization and 
  interpretation.
- Dashboard Creation: Designed interactive dashboards using Excel's features to integrate pivot tables, charts, and slicers, providing stakeholders with a comprehensive view 
  of employee performance and demographics

### Outcomes and Insights:
- Insights from Pivot Tables: Identified department-wise trends in employee performance metrics, such as productivity and attendance, enabling targeted interventions for 
  improvement.
- Impact of Conditional Formatting: Detected anomalies in employee attendance records through color-coded conditional formatting, prompting further investigation into 
  potential issues affecting workforce management.
- Dashboard Visualization: Developed intuitive dashboards that allowed stakeholders to interactively explore employee data, facilitating informed decision-making and 
  strategic planning.
### DIABETICS PREDICTION USING SQL:
- Data Retrieval and Filtering: Utilized SELECT and WHERE clauses to retrieve specific patient information and filter data based on criteria such as age and gender.
- Aggregation and Analysis: Employed aggregate functions (AVG, MAX, MIN) and sorting (ORDER BY) for statistical analysis and insights into patient health metrics.
- Statistical Analysis and Grouping: Demonstrated advanced analysis techniques, including grouping (GROUP BY), counting (COUNT), and ranking (ROW_NUMBER, DENSE_RANK) for 
  nuanced patient categorization.
- Data Modification and Constraints: Showcased data modification using UPDATE, INSERT INTO, and DELETE FROM. Established a UNIQUE constraint on patient IDs for data 
  integrity.
