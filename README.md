# Psyliq_Data_Analysis_Internship
Hi there! I'm Supriya Bhat V, a proactive data analyst who recently completed a one month internship at Psyliq, successfully tackling three impactful tasks
that involved HR data analysis using Power BI and Excel, Employee Data Analysis using Excel and diabetics prediction using SQL.

### HR DATA ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI AND EXCEL:
- Utilized tools like Excel and Power BI to create visualizations that showcase the distribution of employees across departments, roles, and age groups.
- Analyzed key metrics such as average monthly income, job satisfaction, and salary hike impacts.
- Employ filters and pivot tables to segment data, providing a clear overview of the workforce composition.
- Created visual representations, such as line charts in Power BI, to track trends in employee attrition over the years.
- Utilize calculated columns and DAX to determine average years an employee has spent with their current manager. 
### EMPLOYEE DATA ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL:
1. Pivot Tables:
Pivot tables served as the backbone of my data exploration process. They enabled me to quickly summarize, analyze, and transform raw data into meaningful information, providing a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

2. Charts and Visualizations:
The inclusion of various charts and visualizations brought data to life. Whether it was line charts to identify trends, bar charts for comparisons, or scatter plots for correlations, each visualization was carefully chosen to convey insights effectively.

3. Formulas and Data Manipulation:
Formulas played a crucial role in data manipulation and transformation. From creating calculated fields to deriving new variables, I harnessed Excel's formula capabilities to enhance the depth of my analysis.

4. Dashboards:
The culmination of my EDA efforts resulted in dynamic dashboards that offer a holistic view of the data landscape. These dashboards, created with an emphasis on user-friendly design, empower stakeholders to interact with and derive insights from the data effortlessly.

### DIABETICS PREDICTION USING SQL:
1. SQL Query-Based Database Setup:
I initiated the project by setting up a MySQL database, employing SQL queries for creating tables and defining the schema. This fundamental step laid the groundwork for subsequent data manipulations.

2. Data Preprocessing with SQL Queries:
Addressing data quality was achieved through a series of SQL queries. From handling missing values to cleaning outliers, each query played a crucial role in preparing the dataset for predictive modeling.

3. Predictive Modeling Using SQL:
The heart of the project was the application of SQL queries for predictive modeling. Leveraging SQL's analytical capabilities, I crafted queries to identify potential diabetics based on patterns and trends discovered in the data.

4. Evaluation Metrics Using SQL:
To measure the performance of the predictive model, I utilized SQL queries for basic evaluation metrics. This step ensured that the model's predictions were assessed and validated directly within the database environment.
