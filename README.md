# Psyliq_Data_Analysis_Internship
Hi there! I'm Supriya Bhat V, a proactive data analyst who recently completed a one month internship at Psyliq, successfully tackling three impactful tasks
that involved HR data analysis using Power BI and Excel, Employee Data Analysis using Excel and diabetics prediction using SQL.

### HR DATA ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI AND EXCEL:
- Utilized tools like Excel and Power BI to create visualizations that showcase the distribution of employees across departments, roles, and age groups.
- Analyzed key metrics such as average monthly income, job satisfaction, and salary hike impacts.
- Employ filters and pivot tables to segment data, providing a clear overview of the workforce composition.
- Created visual representations, such as line charts in Power BI, to track trends in employee attrition over the years.
- Utilize calculated columns and DAX to determine average years an employee has spent with their current manager. 
### EMPLOYEE DATA ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL:
- Created a chart to visually represent the distribution of "Work-Life Balance Score" across various job functions.
- Applied conditional formatting to highlight employees with a "Performance Score" below 3 in red.
- Utilized a pivot table to consolidate the total number of employees in each department.
- Developed a dashboard integrating charts and pivot tables to provide an overview of key HR metrics, including headcount, performance, and training costs.
### DIABETICS PREDICTION USING SQL:
1. SQL Query-Based Database Setup:
I initiated the project by setting up a MySQL database, employing SQL queries for creating tables and defining the schema. This fundamental step laid the groundwork for subsequent data manipulations.

2. Data Preprocessing with SQL Queries:
Addressing data quality was achieved through a series of SQL queries. From handling missing values to cleaning outliers, each query played a crucial role in preparing the dataset for predictive modeling.

3. Predictive Modeling Using SQL:
The heart of the project was the application of SQL queries for predictive modeling. Leveraging SQL's analytical capabilities, I crafted queries to identify potential diabetics based on patterns and trends discovered in the data.

4. Evaluation Metrics Using SQL:
To measure the performance of the predictive model, I utilized SQL queries for basic evaluation metrics. This step ensured that the model's predictions were assessed and validated directly within the database environment.
