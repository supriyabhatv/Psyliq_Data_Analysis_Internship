# Psyliq_Data_Analysis_Internship
Hi there! I'm Supriya Bhat V, a proactive data analyst who recently completed a one month internship at Psyliq, successfully tackling three impactful tasks
that involved HR data analysis using Power BI and Excel, Employee Data Analysis using Excel and diabetics prediction using SQL.

### HR DATA ANALYSIS WITH POWER BI AND EXCEL:
1. Pivot Tables in Excel:
I harnessed the power of pivot tables to transform raw HR data into actionable insights. Pivot tables facilitated dynamic data summarization, enabling me to uncover trends and patterns crucial for decision-making.

2. Dashboards in Excel:
Creating interactive dashboards in Excel allowed stakeholders to visualize complex HR metrics effortlessly. I tailored dashboards to highlight key performance indicators, ensuring a user-friendly experience for decision-makers.

3. Power BI Charts and DAX:
The integration of Power BI took data visualization to the next level. I leveraged Power BI charts to present HR analytics with clarity. Additionally, utilizing DAX formulas enhanced the depth of analysis, enabling the extraction of more nuanced insights from the dataset.

### EMPLOYEE DATA ANALYSIS WITH EXCEL:
1. Pivot Tables:
Pivot tables served as the backbone of my data exploration process. They enabled me to quickly summarize, analyze, and transform raw data into meaningful information, providing a solid foundation for subsequent analysis.

2. Charts and Visualizations:
The inclusion of various charts and visualizations brought data to life. Whether it was line charts to identify trends, bar charts for comparisons, or scatter plots for correlations, each visualization was carefully chosen to convey insights effectively.

3. Formulas and Data Manipulation:
Formulas played a crucial role in data manipulation and transformation. From creating calculated fields to deriving new variables, I harnessed Excel's formula capabilities to enhance the depth of my analysis.

4. Dashboards:
The culmination of my EDA efforts resulted in dynamic dashboards that offer a holistic view of the data landscape. These dashboards, created with an emphasis on user-friendly design, empower stakeholders to interact with and derive insights from the data effortlessly.

### DIABETICS PREDICTION USING SQL:
1. SQL Query-Based Database Setup:
I initiated the project by setting up a MySQL database, employing SQL queries for creating tables and defining the schema. This fundamental step laid the groundwork for subsequent data manipulations.

2. Data Preprocessing with SQL Queries:
Addressing data quality was achieved through a series of SQL queries. From handling missing values to cleaning outliers, each query played a crucial role in preparing the dataset for predictive modeling.

3. Predictive Modeling Using SQL:
The heart of the project was the application of SQL queries for predictive modeling. Leveraging SQL's analytical capabilities, I crafted queries to identify potential diabetics based on patterns and trends discovered in the data.

4. Evaluation Metrics Using SQL:
To measure the performance of the predictive model, I utilized SQL queries for basic evaluation metrics. This step ensured that the model's predictions were assessed and validated directly within the database environment.
